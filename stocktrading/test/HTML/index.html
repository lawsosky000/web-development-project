            <p>A discount broker, basic computer, and a three year old phone provide me with all the necessary
                infrastructure to
                trade stocks. Stock trading is the practice of utilizing large amounts of capital to purchase
                significant
                blocks
                of
                shares in order to take advantage of small price movements. Most traders trade the stock of
                corporations
                in
                the
                New
                York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ markets. I largely apply technical analysis, which is the use of
                previous
                price
                trends and patterns to predict the movements of future stock prices. When I trade nearly all the two
                hundred
                and
                fifty two trading days in a year, I wake up in the morning an hour before the market opens at 9:30
                ET
                and
                begin
                building my watchlist. I utilize a dollar gainer and dollar loser scanner to help me efficiently
                target
                the
                best
                pattern setups that coordinate with my trading plan; this is a set of personal rules most successful
                traders
                follow
                that function as a boss. It is not permitted within the parameters of my plan to risk more than
                forty
                dollars on
                a
                two to one risk to reward trade. When the market opens it is crucial to anticipate when a stock
                might
                move
                past
                a
                resistance level, resulting in a breakout. This takes patience and discipline to keep track of and
                observe
                all
                the
                movements on my watchlist. I enter on institutional volume, or after there is a volume spike. It is
                critical
                to
                set
                a stop loss and take profit on trades, adjusting them according to the situation. I have set
                numerous
                goals
                to
                guide
                me to become a better trader. I record all of my trades on a spreadsheet so I can learn from my
                mistakes
                and
                review
                what I did well. Having read books such as the Intelligent Investor and the Ultimate Day Trader have
                expanded my
                knowledge of stock trading, and I am currently reading High Probability Trading by Marcel Link. I
                also
                enjoy
                participating in weekly virtual lectures by a former stock broker, Jared Wesley, to learn new
                strategies
                and
                gather
                ideas that may benefit my personal trading.
